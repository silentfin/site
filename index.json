[1] 9826 segmentation fault (core dumped) QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb apulse ./AppRun Now I got slightly different errors. Then I ran this to create a fake pulseaudio library\ncat \u0026gt; /tmp/fake_pulse.c \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;EOF\u0026#39; #include \u0026lt;stddef.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; typedef struct pa_simple pa_simple; pa_simple* pa_simple_new(void* a, void* b, int c, void* d, void* e, void* f, void* g, void* h, int* error) { printf(\u0026#34;fake pa_simple_new called\\n\u0026#34;); if (error) *error = 0; return (pa_simple*)0xDEADBEEF; // Return fake pointer } int pa_simple_read(pa_simple* s, void* data, size_t bytes, int* error) { if (error) *error = 0; return 0; // Success } void pa_simple_free(pa_simple* s) { printf(\u0026#34;fake pa_simple_free called\\n\u0026#34;); } int pa_simple_write(pa_simple* s, const void* data, size_t bytes, int* error) { if (error) *error = 0; return 0; } const char* pa_strerror(int error) { return \u0026#34;No error (fake)\u0026#34;; } EOF and then\ngcc -shared -fPIC -o /tmp/libfake_pulse.so /tmp/fake_pulse.c and again ran transcreen using this\nLD_PRELOAD=/tmp/libfake_pulse.so QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb ./AppRun Now, finally the application launched, I had a window running!\nBut it was in Chinese and I dont know chinese!\nAttempted to enable English # Here are the files ls /opt/Transcreen in\ndoc plugins translations config.ini default.desktop Transcreen lib qml AppRun cursor.png qt.conf I tried modifying config.ini which had the following content.\n[CONFIG] ################################################## ################# 【基本配置信息】 ############### ################################################## # 语言设置 language=1 # 镜像投屏授权 Autoaccept=1 So, tried changing the value of language to 0, 2, 3, -1, en, eng and english but it was still in chinese.\nTried forcing english\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/libfake_pulse.so QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb ./AppRun but failed.\nAlso tried finding any other config files in ~/.config/Transcreen but it didn\u0026rsquo;t existed.\nAt this point, I thought fine I\u0026rsquo;m gonna use it in chinese as long as it works I\u0026rsquo;m good and made this simple translation guide for myself.\nAlso, make sure to allow the firewall for the application according to your distro. I used this\nsudo firewall-cmd --add-service=mdns --permanent sudo firewall-cmd --reload And now I\u0026rsquo;m good to go.\nBlack Screen on Niri # Now it was time to test it. I tried sharing my screen via Niri and got a BLACK screen.\nI thought maybe the application was faulty, so I switched to Cinnamon and tried again and it worked perfectly.\nSo the issue was specific to Wayland. I tried installing screen capture portals:\nsudo pacman -S xdg-desktop-portal xdg-desktop-portal-gnome Configured portal preferences in ~/.config/xdg-desktop-portal/portals.conf:\n[preferred] default=gnome;gtk org.freedesktop.impl.portal.ScreenCast=gnome Restarted the portal:\nsystemctl --user restart xdg-desktop-portal Still black screen. Tried a few more compatibility tweaks but nothing worked.\nThe reason: Transcreen uses old X11 screen capture APIs that don\u0026rsquo;t support modern Wayland compositors. There\u0026rsquo;s no fix for this without the developers rewriting the app to use PipeWire screencasting.\nBottom line: You need an X11 DE or WM to use Transcreen.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s where I am right now - it works great on Cinnamon, but not on my preferred Niri setup.\nSuccess \u0026hellip;well kinda! # Prerequisites: Any X11 DE or WM\nHere is the final stuff that worked:\nStep-1: Run the following commands to create a fake pulseaudio library\ncat \u0026gt; /tmp/fake_pulse.c \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;EOF\u0026#39; #include \u0026lt;stddef.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; typedef struct pa_simple pa_simple; pa_simple* pa_simple_new(void* a, void* b, int c, void* d, void* e, void* f, void* g, void* h, int* error) { printf(\u0026#34;fake pa_simple_new called\\n\u0026#34;); if (error) *error = 0; return (pa_simple*)0xDEADBEEF; // Return fake pointer } int pa_simple_read(pa_simple* s, void* data, size_t bytes, int* error) { if (error) *error = 0; return 0; // Success } void pa_simple_free(pa_simple* s) { printf(\u0026#34;fake pa_simple_free called\\n\u0026#34;); } int pa_simple_write(pa_simple* s, const void* data, size_t bytes, int* error) { if (error) *error = 0; return 0; } const char* pa_strerror(int error) { return \u0026#34;No error (fake)\u0026#34;; } EOF gcc -shared -fPIC -o /tmp/libfake_pulse.so /tmp/fake_pulse.c make it permanent\nsudo mkdir -p /opt/Transcreen/lib/custom sudo mv /tmp/libfake_pulse.so /opt/Transcreen/lib/custom/ Step-2: Create a permanent script by running the following\nsudo nano /usr/local/bin/transcreen remove existing data and add the following\n#!/bin/bash cd /opt/Transcreen LD_PRELOAD=/opt/Transcreen/lib/custom/libfake_pulse.so QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb /opt/Transcreen/AppRun \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; Press Ctrl+X, then y and finally press enter to save the file.\nMake it executable:\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/transcreen Step-3: Create a desktop entry\nsudo nano /usr/share/applications/transcreen.desktop add this data\n[Desktop Entry] Name=Transcreen Comment=Wireless Screen Casting Exec=/usr/local/bin/transcreen Icon=/opt/Transcreen/cursor.png Terminal=false Type=Application Categories=Network;AudioVideo; Step-4: Allow transcreen through the firewall. I use firewall-cmd, check what your system uses.\nsudo firewall-cmd --add-service=mdns --permanent sudo firewall-cmd --reload Step-5: Launch the application either via terminal or via the application launcher(if you added a desktop entry at step-4)\ntranscreen Now, get in the same network and enter the device IP shown on the smartboard and press the big blue button at the bottom to share the screen.\nHere is a picture of it running, Conclusion # I thought to myself that I only have to share my screen rarely and I have already invested so much time debugging it. It works flawlessly now on Cinnamon tho but I really wanted it running on Niri. But this is it for now, maybe in future I will pick this up again and work on it.\nThis was such an amazing debugging session that I had. Got to learn about so many things that I never thought even existed, glad that I finally switched to EndeavourOS from LinuxMint 2 months ago. In the past few months, I learned so many things that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t in the past few years.\nNote: I used Claude AI to help troubleshoot and document this process. The debugging was collaborative as I ran the commands and reported errors, while Claude suggested fixes and explained why things were failing.\n","date":"9 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/how-i-made-transcreen-work-on-linux/","section":"Posts","summary":"Fixed Transcreen on Linux using a fake PulseAudio library and X11 (Wayland not supported).","title":"How I Made Transcreen Work on Linux","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"9 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/linux/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Linux","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pipewire/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pipewire","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"9 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/screenshare/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Screenshare","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/transcreen/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Transcreen","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/x11/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"X11","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/life/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Life","type":"tags"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s 04:43 AM right now and I\u0026rsquo;m done with the first decent version of this website and I\u0026rsquo;m happy now.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m still not satisfied, I still have to modify so many things that I couldnt do today so there is that but doing something which makes you lose track of time in a good way is something that I can never get tired of.\nEven now, when its 5AM now, I can still do more stuff and go on for a couple more hours but this is enough for today.
