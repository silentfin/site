It's 04:43 AM right now and I'm done with the first decent version of this website and I'm happy now.  
But I'm still not satisfied, I still have to modify so many things that I couldnt do today so there is that but doing something which makes you lose track of time in a good way is something that I can never get tired of.  

Even now, when its 5AM now, I can still do more stuff and go on for a couple more hours but this is enough for today. I have achieved what i planned 12hrs ago so I'm glad that I was able to achieve my target.  

That's all I'm gonna say.  GoodBye!
