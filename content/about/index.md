Hey, I'm silentfin. I'm a CS student who spends too much time tweaking my Arch setup (check my [dots](https://github.com/silentfin/dotfiles)).  

I'm into building CLI tools and automation scripts. Right now I'm learning FastAPI and working on a URL shortener.  
Besides coding, I'm into gaming, anime and books.

I made this site to share what I learn.
